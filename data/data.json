Virtual reality helps stimulate senses such as smell, vision, touch, and hearing. In virtual reality, the computer uses sensors and math. Rather than locating a real camera within a physical environment, the user\u2019s eyes are positioned within the simulated environment. The graphics react according to the head movements of the user.

    "Tree Fruit production": "Fruit trees are not usually grown from seed because if they are, the fruit doesn't usually taste very good! That's because many fruit trees are cross pollinated. Fruit trees have some DNA from the mother tree and some from the father tree. The resulting seed will have a completely new genetic make-up. And if you plant that seed, the new tree will produce fruit that is nothing like the fruit produced by either parent.Grafted fruit trees are like an insurance policy that can offer the following benefits:They will provide you with a guaranteed variety like Honey crisp or Gala apples.They may offer pest and disease resistance.They may be selected to withstand cold climates.",
    "Grazing management": "Grazing management must address the need to integrate parasite control measures together with the provision of sufficient quantities of nutritious grass at the correct stage of growth throughout the grazing season.Grazing management is the planning, implementation and monitoring of animal grazing to achieve sustained animal, plant, land, environmental and economic results under a range of environmental conditions.Grazing management practices seek to optimize livestock production and maintain productive grasslands by minimizing overgrazing, improving forage production and increasing plant and animal diversity. Grazing, when well-managed, allows healthy grasslands to be sustained, livestock operations to meet economic requirements and other plants and animals to flourish. Well-managed grazing techniques can reverse damage and help to restore grassland health.",
